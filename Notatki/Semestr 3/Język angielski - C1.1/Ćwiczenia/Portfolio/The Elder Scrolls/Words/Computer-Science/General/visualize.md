Translation: **Wizualizacja**

Definition: 

The act of representing data or information in a way that can be easily understood or interpreted, typically using visual elements such as charts, graphs, or diagrams.

Visualization can be used to communicate complex information in a more accessible way, making it easier for people to understand and make decisions. It can also be used to explore data and identify patterns or trends that might not be apparent from traditional text-based presentations.

There are many different ways to visualize data, depending on the type of data and the purpose of the visualization. Some common types of visualizations include:

- **Charts**: Charts are used to show how data changes over time or across different categories. They can be used to show trends, compare data, or identify outliers.
    
- **Graphs**: Graphs are used to show the relationships between different variables. They can be used to show correlations, identify causal relationships, or model complex systems.
    
- **Diagrams**: Diagrams are used to represent data in a more abstract way. They can be used to show organizational structures, flow processes, or causal relationships.

Example:

- A line chart can be used to show how the price of a stock has changed over time.
