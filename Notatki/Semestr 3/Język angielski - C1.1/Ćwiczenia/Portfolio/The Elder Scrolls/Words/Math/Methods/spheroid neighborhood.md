|**Collection of points close to a spheroid** |A spheroid neighborhood is a collection of points that are close to a particular spheroid.|
|**Distance from the spheroid** |The size of the neighborhood depends on the distance from the spheroid.|
|**Level of detail** |The size of the neighborhood also depends on the desired level of detail.|
|**Used in computer graphics** |Spheroid neighborhoods are used in computer graphics for a variety of tasks, such as spheroid detection, spheroid filtering, and spheroid rendering.|

Spheroid neighborhoods are a fundamental concept in computer graphics. They are used to identify, manipulate, and render spheroids in 3D computer graphics.

Example:
To render a spheroid on a computer screen, we can use a spheroid neighborhood to sample the color and texture of the spheroid at different points on its surface. This allows us to create a smooth and realistic representation of the spheroid.
