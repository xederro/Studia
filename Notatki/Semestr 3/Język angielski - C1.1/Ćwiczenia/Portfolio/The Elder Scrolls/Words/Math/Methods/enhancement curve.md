Definition: 

A enhancement curve, also known as a filter response curve or frequency response curve, is a graphical representation of the gain or attenuation of a filter or system as a function of frequency.

|**Graphical representation** |An enhancement curve is a graphical representation of the gain or attenuation of a filter or system as a function of frequency.|
|**Gain or attenuation** |An enhancement curve shows how much a filter or system amplifies or diminishes the amplitude of a signal at different frequencies.|
|**Used in signal processing** |Enhancement curves are used in signal processing to analyze the frequency response of filters and systems.|
|**Important in audio and video processing** |Enhancement curves are important in audio and video processing, where they are used to improve the quality of audio and video signals.|

Enhancement curves are a fundamental tool in signal processing. They are used to understand how filters and systems affect signals, and to design filters and systems that meet specific requirements.

Example:
To remove the low-frequency rumble from an audio signal, we can apply a low-pass filter with a sharp cutoff frequency. The enhancement curve of the filter will show a sharp decrease in gain below the cutoff frequency.
