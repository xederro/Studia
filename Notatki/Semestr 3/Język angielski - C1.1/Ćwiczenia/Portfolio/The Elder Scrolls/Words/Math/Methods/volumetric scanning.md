Definition: 

Volumetric scanning, also known as 3D scanning, is a process of creating a three-dimensional representation of an object or scene. It involves capturing data from multiple viewpoints and then using that data to create a 3D model.

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Creating 3D representations** |Volumetric scanning creates 3D representations of objects or scenes.|
|**Capturing data from multiple viewpoints** |Volumetric scanning captures data from multiple viewpoints to create a complete 3D representation.|
|**Using data to create 3D models** |The captured data is used to create a 3D model that represents the object or scene.|
|**Wide range of applications** |Volumetric scanning has a wide range of applications in various fields, including manufacturing, engineering, medicine, and archaeology.|

Example:
A manufacturing engineer might use volumetric scanning to create a 3D model of a new product prototype. The model can then be used to analyze the product's design and identify potential problems that could affect its performance.
