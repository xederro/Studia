Definition:

Phase-contrast microtomography (PCMT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that utilizes the phase shift of light to generate 3-D images of minute objects. Unlike traditional x-ray microtomography, PCMT does not rely on the absorption of light, making it less damaging to delicate specimens.
