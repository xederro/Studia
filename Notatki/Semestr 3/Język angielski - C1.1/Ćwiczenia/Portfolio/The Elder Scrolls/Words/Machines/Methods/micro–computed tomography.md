Definition: 

Microcomputed tomography (µCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses X-rays to create three-dimensional images of objects at the microscale. It is a powerful tool for visualizing structures that cannot be seen with traditional microscopy.

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|**Non-invasive imaging technique**|µCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that does not require the use of ionizing radiation.|
|**X-rays**|µCT uses X-rays to create three-dimensional images of objects.|
|**Microscale**|µCT can create images of objects at the microscale (<100 μm).|
|**Wide range of applications**|µCT has a wide range of applications in various fields, including biology, medicine, and materials science.|

µCT is used in a wide range of applications, including:

- **Anatomy and pathology:** µCT can be used to image bones, organs, and tumors.
