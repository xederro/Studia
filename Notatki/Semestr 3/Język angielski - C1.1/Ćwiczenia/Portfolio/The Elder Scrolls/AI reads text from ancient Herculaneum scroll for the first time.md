# Summary

A 21-year-old computer science student, Luke Farritor, has successfully developed a machine-learning algorithm that can read the text inside a carbonized scroll from the ancient Roman city of Herculaneum. This achievement was a part of the Vesuvius Challenge and has the potential to unveil numerous texts from the only library to survive from Greco-Roman era, buried by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. The algorithm, which detected Greek letters on the scrolls was using subtle surface texture and color differences, earned him a prize of $40,000 for reading more than 10 characters in a small area. The data was provided by William Brent Seales and his team by the techniques, which involved X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans and machine learning to virtually unwrap and analyze the scrolls' content. The ultimate aim is to utilize artificial intelligence to reveal the texts from all the library's resources.
